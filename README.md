Lil bugger, shut up and stop stalling, idiot! Also, while <p+number> works, it is not needed, i believe.

<main>
  <p>Darewolves is a certified idiot</p>
  <p>But as much as an idiot as you are, you aren't that stupid, are you?</p>
  
  <h3>Img Element</h3>
  
  <p> Img elements are self closing. This means that they do not need a < /img > at the end, as the image code/src is part of the first <>, starting from < img src=> </p>
  <p>The link slash source will be in " " and after the =. The alt element is like this too. For example, alt="insert" and comes after the sourse. The alt is like a caption, basicaly shows if the picture doesnt load. You can leave it empty if the image isnt important, as it's like a caption, the have the person know what the picture is of. </p>

  <p>Later, we will learn how to make the image smaller in css. Stick to HTML stuff for now, dare. However, once you learn cc, you can go ahead and make your own Ao3 site colors and stuff. </p>
  
  <h2>Anchor Element</h2>
  
  <p> An anchor element, 'a' is used to link to sites outside of this webpage. The destination is the href. This element is not self closing. However, the link is put in the first <a>. a href="link" Then between these, you put the text you want to show up. For example, 'Hoshiguma'. Clicking on it will lead to whatever page you set, for example, Hoshiguma's gamepress page.</p>
                  
  <a href="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/operator/hoshiguma/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoshiguma's Gamepress Page</a>
                  
  <p id="wp-anchor">On the other hand, this anchor element can also be used to skip/jump to different parts of the webpage. FreeCodeCamp says it's called an internal link. Anyway, you give the href an # attribute, basically, href="#blank" The blank is where you put the id of the element you want to jump to. "An id is an attribute that uniquely identifies an element." Just like real ids.You assign an id with id="blank". You put this, for example, after the <p . Making it a <p id="blank. I will set the "You idiot!" paragraph's id to insult-two. Also, footer is another element. It's, y'know, a footer. I will then stick another anchor to send you back.</p>
  
  <a href="#insult-two">Anchor to insult-two</a>
  
  <p> Another note on this anchor element. If you would like it to open in a new page, you can add 'target="_blank" ' in the first set of brackets. For example, this link to Matoimaru's page will open in new tab, I believe. Starting the attribute slash element with an # probably makes it an internal thing. Basically, on this webpage.</p>
  
  <a href="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/operator/matoimaru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Matoimaru's Gamepress page, in another tab.</a>
  
  <p> Yeah i know it doesnt work, ill fix it later. You can actually dump link elements into text elements. Like this <a href="#insult-two">anchor<a> This is, uh, anchor text? Anyway, for anchor elements with dead links. you set the href to #. href="#". You now have an anchor, placeholder, that doesnt work! Like this <a href="#">[one]</a> Let's go to another attribute. 'rel' is also put in the first bracket, after the target, I believe. rel stands for relationship! It sets the relationship between your page and the link. Setting it to 'noopener norefferer' stops tabnabbing, apparently. </p>
  <p>You wanna know how to turn a photo into a link? Look a bit further, after this sentence. First you dump your image(code and all) between an anchor element, between the 2 sets of brackets. Remember, sticking '#' for the href makes it a dead link! Remember to add an alt</p>

  <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    
  <p>It may not open in a new tab, but like, I don't know what the problem is, so let's ignore it for now. Did you know that you can create bullet lists in html? Now you definitely do! This is an unordered list. The element for is this 'ul', which, y'know, stands for unordered list. Now, start another line, and use the element 'li'. Each line/thing you list need a set of the 'li' tags. When your list is done, use '/ul'. Below is a list of things Darewolves are.</p>
  
  <ul> 
    <li>An idiot</li>
    <li>Stupid</li>
    <li>smolbrain</li>
    <li>deadbeat doctor</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
  
  <p>The element for unordered lists is 'ul', so for ordered lists it is 'ol'. This is the only difference. You still used the 'li' for the items. Below is an ordered list of the hardest enemies so far in global.</p>
    
  <ol>
    <li>Talulah</li>
    <li>Patriot</li>
    <li>Frostnova</li>
  </ol>
