  <p>Darewolves is a certified idiot</p>
  <p>But as much as an idiot as you are, you aren't that stupid, are you?</p>
  <p> Img elements are self closing. This means that they do not need a < /img > at the end, as the image code/src is part of the first <>, starting from < img src=> </p>
    <p>The link slash source will be in " " and after the =. The alt element is like this too. For example, alt="insert" and comes after the sourse. The alt is like a caption, basicaly shows if the picture doesnt load. You can leave it empty if the image isnt important, as it's like a caption, the have the person know what the picture is of. </p>

  <p>Later, we will learn how to make the image smaller in css. Stick to HTML stuff for now, dare. </p>
