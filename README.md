<p>Darewolves, dont back out now!</p>


<p>You dumb fucking darewolves!</p>

<p id="insult-two">You idiot!</p>
<a href="#wp-anchor"> Sends to you the paragraph about webpage anchors</a>

Lil bugger, shut up and stop stalling, idiot! Also, while <p+number> works, it is not needed, i believe.

  <p>Darewolves is a certified idiot</p>
  <p>But as much as an idiot as you are, you aren't that stupid, are you?</p>
  <p> Img elements are self closing. This means that they do not need a < /img > at the end, as the image code/src is part of the first <>, starting from < img src=> </p>
  <p>The link slash source will be in " " and after the =. The alt element is like this too. For example, alt="insert" and comes after the sourse. The alt is like a caption, basicaly shows if the picture doesnt load. You can leave it empty if the image isnt important, as it's like a caption, the have the person know what the picture is of. </p>
  
  <img src="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/sites/arknights/files/2020-03/char_136_hsguma_nian%233.png" alt="Hoshiguma Patrolling Ronin skin">
  
  <p>Later, we will learn how to make the image smaller in css. Stick to HTML stuff for now, dare. However, once you learn cc, you can go ahead and make your own Ao3 site colors and stuff. </p>
  <p> An anchor element, 'a' is used to link to sites outside of this webpage. The destination is the href. This element is not self closing. However, the link is put in the first <a>. a href="link" Then between these, you put the text you want to show up. For example, 'Hoshiguma'. Clicking on it will lead to whatever page you set, for example, Hoshiguma's gamepress page.</p>
                  
  <a href="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/operator/hoshiguma">Hoshiguma's Gamepress Page</a>
                  
  <p id=wp-anchor>On the other hand, this anchor element can also be used to skip/jump to different parts of the webpage. FreeCodeCamp says it's called an internal link. Anyway, you give the href an # attribute, basically, href="#blank" The blank is where you put the id of the element you want to jump to. "An id is an attribute that uniquely identifies an element." Just like real ids.You assign an id with id="blank". You put this, for example, after the <p . Making it a <p id="blank. I will set the "You idiot!" paragraph's id to insult-two. Also, footer is another element. It's, y'know, a footer. I will then stick another anchor to send you back.</p>
  
  <a href="#insult-two">Anchor to insult-two</a>
  
  <p> Another note on this anchor element. If you would like it to open in a new page, you can add 'target="_blank" ' in the first set of brackets. For example, this link to Hoshiguma's page will open in new tab, I believe. </p>
  
  <a href="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/operator/hoshiguma" target="_blank"> Hoshiguma Gamepress page, but in another tab.</a>
